        <h3>WhatsApp chatBot</h3>This project aims to develop an intelligent WhatsApp chatbot that leverages the capabilities of Python for its core logic and MongoDB for efficient data storage and management. The bot will facilitate seamless communication with users, providing instant responses and handling data dynamically. This system is designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly, catering to various use cases such as customer support, information dissemination, and automated tasks. This is live project based on the requirement of the company management to manage all there daily stock, expenses, and inventory so they can store, handle, all the data remotely in a systematic manner.  
        <h4>Contributions:</h4> Data handing by using MongoDB.
